Before proceeding further,
Cleanse the existing stuff in vector & mongodb.
A new deep-diver approach on top of what we did.
The real source extractor for my projects with humoungous files
Instead of bulk projects, focus on single project.
Deep dive should be file-by-file, folder-by-folder, line-by-line
To achieve this, I am going to implement a few steps to crack this out.
Over all the projects that sit in my laptop
I havent wrote anything from scratch, and mostly prompted my way out for all kinds of solutions to Github Copilot and AWS KIRO
few over copilot, few over kiro.
So, we are going to reverse-engineer this.
Gather the entire context stored per project,
session history, chat history, prompts & responses - file contents.
Restore all of them into our knowledge base with a new set of DB's in both Vector & Mongo.
1) Map this to our chat-assistant as well - the knowledgebase
for my spec-engineering struggles, priniciples, apporaches used
to converse all that stuff
2) Use this to strengthen my domain knowledge
3) Create a prompt library, and showcase the prompts I have used to so far and tackled challenges. Where I went fast & where I went slower & where I was in hell & where I quit.
4) Be the part of the Data Ingestion Engine for stuff that I learnt by project-based experimental learning
5) Feed this as a part of data source for resume building, chatbot, and showcase library
